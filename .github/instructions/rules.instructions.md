- Strictly follow existing project folder structure; never add new top-level directories.
- Do not create unnecessary files like summary.md, test.py, example tests, or test_feature folders.
- Always create changelog entries in .changelog/ folder with timestamp titles (e.g., auth_updates_202512-23T214200Z.md).
- Keep changelog details very short: only "what implemented," no extra commentary.
- Use async/await for all endpoints and I/O operations.
- Place routers in app/api/v1/ by feature; mount in main.py.
- Define Pydantic schemas in app/schemas/; use dependency injection for DB/security.
- Always activate venv before executing any command
- import always should start with app.subfolder.file
- Must follow clean and meaningful naming conventions e.g: `state.py` is not good it should be `workflow_state.py` or `app_state.py`, same `status.py` is not good name.
- must use absolute imports like: `from app.subfolder.file import Xyz`
- Always put constant string and messages in constant file.
- Delete the test files after using them for testing purpose.
